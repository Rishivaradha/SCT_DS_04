Road Traffic Accident Data Analysis

This project involves analyzing a road traffic accident dataset to extract meaningful insights. The dataset contains various attributes related to accidents, such as the time of the accident, the severity, the type of vehicle involved, and contributing factors. The goal of this analysis is to visualize accident hotspots, contributing factors, and trends in accident severity.

Overview

The project focuses on:

Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset.
Visualizing key factors contributing to accidents.
Analyzing accident severity by various factors such as vehicle type, driver age, and time of day.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:

Time: Time of the accident.
Day_of_week: Day of the week when the accident occurred.
Age_band_of_driver: Age group of the driver.
Sex_of_driver: Gender of the driver.
Type_of_vehicle: Type of vehicle involved in the accident.
Accident_severity: Severity of the accident (e.g., slight injury, serious injury).
Latitude: Latitude of the accident location.
Longitude: Longitude of the accident location.
Cause_of_accident: Contributing factors to the accident.
Casualty_class: Type of casualty involved (e.g., pedestrian, driver).

Installation

To get started with the project, you need to install the following libraries:

Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
Matplotlib: For creating visualizations.
Seaborn: For enhanced visualizations.

Visualizations

The project generates various visualizations to better understand accident trends, including:

Accidents by Gender: A pie chart showing the distribution of accidents by the gender of the driver.
Accidents by Vehicle Type: A bar chart visualizing the number of accidents by vehicle type.
Accidents by Severity: A bar chart showing the distribution of accidents by severity.
Accident Hotspots: A heatmap of accident locations based on latitude and longitude.
Accidents by Time of Day: A bar chart showing accident trends by the hour of the day.
